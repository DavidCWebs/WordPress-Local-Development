# WordPress Local Development
The goal of this is to document and then automate setting up a proper WordPress development machine -- not a server, a PC -- on Ubuntu 16.04.

Right now its [a set of instructions](https://github.com/Shelob9/WordPress-Local-Development/blob/master/go-to-space-today.md), not totally complete, to get vitualbox, vagrant, all the VCS/ dependency managment as well as 2 or 3 actual development environments running. Also phpStorm and Atom.

Pull requests <em>super</em> welcome.


## Goals
* Complete install instructions
* Automate with Ansible or something
