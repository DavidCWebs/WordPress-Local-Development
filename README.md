# WordPress Local Development
The goal of this is to document and then automate setting up a proper WordPress development machine -- not a server, a PC -- on Ubuntu 16.04.

Right now its a set of instructions, not totally complete to get vitualbox, vagrant, all the VCS/ dependency managment as well as 2 or 3 actual development environments running. Also phpStorm and Atom.


## Goals
* Complete install instructions
* Automate with Ansible or something
